    <p>The Automated Watering System is a VHDL design project for the embedded systems course Introduction to Digital Logic and Hardware Architecture.
        The system continuously checks the soil moisture level and rain forecasted. Based on these measurements a water valve is either opened or left 
        closed. The duration the valve is left open depends on the water initially present or forecasted. For example, very dry soil and no rain 
        forecasted will require the valve be left open longer than if the soil was initially moist and some rain was forecasted. The system accomplishes 
        this by continuously checking the soil moisture and rain forecasted, even while the valve is open. Once the soil is saturated, the valve will be 
        closed again.</p>
        
    <h4>Initial Steps</h4>
    <p>Below is a summary of the initial steps I took in order to get to a working model.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Noted the inputs and output of the system</li>
        <li>Made a truth table relating the inputs and output, including the minterms</li>
        <li>Used the I/O relation to design a state transition diagram</li>
        <li>Used the minterms and state transition diagram to begin coding in SystemVerilog</li>
        <li>Switched to VHDL because I couldn't get the testbench to run in SystemVerilog for a Final State Machine (FSM)</li>
        <li>Encountered delay issues with the simulation waveforms</li>
        <li>Fine-tuned the testbench delays to display readable waveforms</li>
        <li>Encountered issues interpreting the resulting waveforms</li>
        <li>Understood that the testbench doesn't test for every possibility</li>
        <li>Designed a testbench that tests for the likeliest of possibilities</li>
    </ol>
        
    
    <h4>Inputs and Outputs</h4>    
    <p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/601/21173403441_7136936bdb_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="I/O Bits" /></p>    
    <p>There are two inputs: soil moisture level and rain forecasted. Each input is represented with two bits: (M1, M0) and (R1, R0). This gives four 
        levels of intensity per input.</p>
    <p>For simplicity, there is only one output: valve. The valve is either opened or closed, so one bit is sufficient to represent the output: V.</p>
    <p>Let's believe that fully saturated soil is represented by (M1, M0) = (1, 1) and that a rain forecast of 
        (R1, R0) = (1, 1) is enough to fully saturate the soil. Let's also believe that we want the soil to be fully saturated at all times or know that 
        the rain forecasted will fully saturate the soil. My plants apparently love moisture. This means if the addition of (M1, M0) and (R1, R0) does 
        not equal at least (1, 1) then we want to open the valve, represented by V = 1. The below Truth Table defines this behavior.</p>
    
    <p>Truth Table
    <table id="truth">
    <tr class="first"><td>M1</td><td>M0</td><td>R1</td><td>R0</td><td class="v">V</td><td>minterm</td></tr>
    <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td class="v">1</td><td>M1'M0'R1'R0'</td></tr>
    <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td class="v">1</td><td>M1'M0'R1'R0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td class="v">1</td><td>M1'M0'R1R0'</td></tr>

    <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td class="v">1</td><td>M1'M0R1'R0'</td></tr>
    <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td class="v">1</td><td>M1'M0R1'R0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td class="v">0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td class="v">0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td class="v">1</td><td>M1M0'R1'R0'</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td class="v">0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td class="v">0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td class="v">0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td class="v">0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td class="v">0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td class="v">0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td class="v">0</td></tr>
    </table></p>
     
    <p>This behavior is nice. We got the valve open. But how long do we want the valve to remain open? How do we close the valve? The answer is 
        with states! We want to throw the system into different states depending on how long we want the valve to remain open. I decided to use four 
        states: S0, S1, S2, S3. Each state represents the level of water necessary to saturate the soil fully. For example, an initial reading of 
        (M1, M0) = (0, 0) and (R1, R0) = (0, 0) will throw the system into state = S3, where V = 1. From S3, the system will progressively drop to a 
        lower state until reaching S0, where V = 0. This makes sense, as the valve releases water into the soil, the soil will require less water and 
        thus drop into a state that represents this. The below State Transition Diagram and Next State Table define this behavior for all states.</p>

    <p>A different state transition diagram can achieve the same effect. I initially had designed the diagram such that S1, S2, S3 fed directly 
    back to S0. This design required a lot of repetitive code and defeated the purpose of using multiple states. Feeding S3 into S2 into S1 into 
    S0 saves code and differentiates each state.</p>
    
    <h4>VHDL Code</h4>
    <p>After a state transition diagram, we can begin coding. I initially began coding in SystemVerilog but because I couldn't get the testbench 
        running in <a href="http://www.edaplayground.com/">EDA Playground</a> I switched to VHDL. I later learned that SystemVerilog requires 
        additional code and markers just to simulate in EDA Playground. Linked is my <a href="http://www.edaplayground.com/x/4Ug">VHDL source code</a>. 
        Of particular interest is the following condition for state S0. If you look closely, you'll notice each of the conditions to move from S0 to another 
        state match the minterms previously listed in the Truth Table. This makes sense because the Truth Table describes the starting state S0 
        and each minterm describes a state where V = 1 is true. V = 1 is only true for states S1, S2, S3.</p>

    <h4>Simulation</h4>
    <p>Of the three testbench models given in the text [1], I decided to use a test vector file because of its complexity and familiarity. I used 
        this model to test a simple logic circuit previously. Now, I needed to apply it to a FSM. Previously with the simple logic circuit, the inputs 
        tested the circuit for every possibility. For some reason I thought this would do the same for my FSM. This not the case. As with each new 
        clock cycle the testbench reevaluates the inputs from the current state's perspective. This means I can't realistically test my design 
        with every possibility but should instead test my design with the most likely of possibilities. Below are two Likely Events.</p>
    <p>Likely Event: S3<img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/577/20978770909_4f3c5e7ee3_z.jpg" width="640" height="270" alt="Likely Test 3" /></p>
    <p>Likely Event: S3 describe a likely pattern of events. Beginning in S0 the valve is closed because, even though the soil moisture is level 0, 
        level 3 rain is forecasted. The forecast now drops to level 0, triggering a state change to S3. In S3 the valve is open and the soil begins 
        to saturate. As the soil moisture increases the state drops to S2 then S1. At level 3 soil moisture the state returns to S0.</p>
    <p>Likely Event: S1<img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/607/20544474633_f91f685671_z.jpg" width="640" height="270" alt="Likely Test 1" /></p>
    <p>Likely Event: S1 is similar to Likely Test: S3. The main difference being that the forecast only drops from level 3 to level 2. This throws the 
        system into S1. S1 only requires that the soil saturate to level 1 before returning to S0. This is because the level 2 rain forecast combined with 
        the level 1 soil moisture will fully saturate the soil.</p>
    <p>The above simulations are just that, simulations. The soil would definitely take longer than 20ns to saturate. In reality the system would 
        remain in a state for seconds/minutes not nanoseconds.</p>
    <p>My greatest issue was interpreting the waveforms after running the simulation for the first time. The waveforms were skewed from one another. 
        I couldn't tell if this was a result of my logic being off or a timing issue. Studying the waveforms closer, I could tell the logic 
        was mostly intact. I then tinkered with the clk, reset, input, and output delays until I understood them. From there, I fine-tuned the delays 
        until the results lined up with what was expected. Realistically the output waveforms would lag behind the input waveforms but for readability, 
        I've synced the waveforms. This wasn't the only delay issue I had. I had trouble displaying the entire waveform on EDA Playground. For some 
        reason, EDA Playground likes to cut your waveforms short by at least one input. To extend the graph I add a 100ns delay after the read vector 
        file loop.</p>
