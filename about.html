    <h2>Making for the Sake of Making</h2>
    
	<p>Sake of Making is a source of inspirational Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and how-to projects. The projects don't follow any specific genre. The only requirement is that it's something worth sharing. However, all the projects are intended to inspire and to educate. After trying a project for yourself, you'll not only have learned a new skill but you'll be thinking "I can make it better." It is with this newfound knowledge and inspiration that I know you will make it better.</p>

    <p>Speaking of DIY, Sake of Making began as the DIY project of Nicholas LaJeunesse. He lives in Portland OR, studies Automation, and says "I can just build that" far too often for his own good. When he's not DIYing, he continues to learn American Sign Language and rock climbing. He is a lifelong learner.</p>
