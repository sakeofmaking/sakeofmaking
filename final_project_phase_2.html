    <h2>Automated Watering System: Phase 2</h2>

    <p>This post is an expansion of the perevious post, <a href="auto_water_system.html">Automated Water System: VHDL</a>. In this expansion, 
        three plots of land are supported each by their own valve. This means each plot of land can have it's soil moisture individually 
        maintained. For the greatest diversity of plants, let's assign each plot of land a different soil preference: dry, normal, moist.
        </p>
    
    <h4>Inputs and Outputs</h4>    
    <p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/605/21113935468_803f55492b_z.jpg" width="640" height="180" alt="I/O Bits" /></p>    
    <p>The soil moisture variability is made possible by adding another input, soil preference, for a total of three inputs of two bits each: 
        (M3, M2), (M1, M0), (R1, R0). This gives four levels of soil moisture per soil preference.</p>
    <p>Three diffent soil preferences means three different valves. Two bits, (V1, V0), are necessary to represent these three valves and an off state.</p> 
    <p>For efficiency, let's assign each of these three plots of land a different soil preference: (V1, V0) = (0, 1) prefers (M3, M2) = (0, 1), 
        (V1, V0) = (1, 0) prefers (M3, M2) = (1, 0), and (V1, V0) = (1, 1) prefers (M3, M2) = (1, 1). The below Truth Table defines this behavior.</p>

    <p>This new Truth Table requires the State Transition Diagram also be updated but only for it's conditions. The actual diagram will remain 
        the same. The conditions now must take into account the soil perference. The below Next State Table does just that.</p>    
     
    <p>State Transition Diagram<img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5669/21155341872_4f63c2832a_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="State Diagram" /></p>
        
    <p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/730/21114930459_48b0171882_c.jpg" width="640" height="800" alt="Next State Table" /></p>    
    
    <p>This updated State Transition Diagram makes full use of the different states. To satisfy each plot of land's soil preference that particular 
        plot of land is thrown into the appropriate state. As the soil moisture changes the plot of land is again passed into a state that represents 
        this before returning to state S0 where the valve is off.</p>    
    
    <h4>VHDL Code</h4>
    <p>With the new Next State Table we can update the VHDL code. Linked is my updated <a href="http://www.edaplayground.com/x/6fx">VHDL source code</a>. 
        The new conditions for S0 are provided below. Again, you'll notice that the conditions match the minterms mentioned earlier in the Truth 
        Table.</p>
        
    <p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/685/21275565726_43025c6da2_z.jpg" width="640" height="240" alt="Code Snippet" /></p>    
        
    <h4>Simulation</h4>
    <p>Below are two likely simulations demonstrating how different soil moistures can be maintained for different plots of land.</p> 
    <p>Dry Soil Preference<img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/636/21309946741_0fbc354688_z.jpg" width="640" height="270" alt="Preference" /></p>
    <p>The plot of land defined by (V1, V0) = (0, 1) has a soil preference (M3, M2) = (0, 1) = dry. This means a rain forecast of (R1, R0) = 
        (0, 1) is enough to satisfy this preference. In the above Dry Soil Preference waveform, the system begins in state S0 because the rain forecasted 
        is (0, 1). When the forecast drops to (0, 0) and the soil moisture (M1, M0) remains (0, 0) the state switches to S1 and the valve is opened. 
        The valve remains open until the soil moisture changes. When the soil moisture reaches the desired (0, 1) the state switches back to S0 and the 
        valve closes.</p>    
    <p>Moist Soil Preference<img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5703/21309947991_cc04b3fe41_z.jpg" width="640" height="270" alt="Preference" /></p>
    <p>The plot of land defined by (V1, V0) = (1, 1) has a soil preference (M3, M2) = (1, 1) = moist. This means a rain forecast of (R1, R0) = 
        (1, 1) is enough to satisfy this preference. In the above Moist Soil Preference waveform, the system begins in state S0 because the rain forecasted 
        is (1, 1). When the forecast drops to (1, 0) and the soil moisture (M1, M0) remains (0, 0) the state switches to S1 and the valve is opened.
        The valve remains open until the soil moisture changes. When the soil moisture reaches the desired (0, 1) the state switches back to S0 and the 
        valve closes.</p>
     <p>The above two simulations are very simular even though they have very different preferences. Both only need one more level of soil 
        moisture to satisfy their soil preference. To increase the soil moisture by one more level both are thrown into state S1.</p>
